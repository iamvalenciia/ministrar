Run this command to build the image on your local machine 
and start the container. You only need to run this command 
the first time, and whenever you make changes to docker-compose.yml:
$ docker-compose up --build --no-recreate -d

------------RUN THIS--------------
From the second time, we can use:
$ docker-compose up -d

To enter in my container:
$ docker exec -it abetterworld sh

To run the app:
npm run dev
----------------------------------

---------- IF YOU CREATE THE IMAGE AGAIN ----------
npm i && npm run dev

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The size that matters for deployments in Docker is typically the virtual size of the container image
To know the size of your container run this command:
$ docker container ls -s

The docker-compose files support declaring default environment variables in the .env file.
